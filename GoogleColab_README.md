# Google Colaboratory

## Introduction

Google Colaboratory, also known as Colab, is a free, cloud-based platform for developing and running machine learning models using Python. It provides users with a Jupyter notebook environment, where they can write and execute code, visualize data, and collaborate with others in real-time. Colab also comes pre-installed with many popular machine learning libraries, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn, making it easy for users to get started with building and training models. Additionally, Colab allows users to easily access and analyze large datasets through integration with Google Drive and Google Cloud Storage. Best of all, Colab requires no setup or installation, as it runs entirely in the browser, making it a convenient and accessible option for students, researchers, and developers alike.
