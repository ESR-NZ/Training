# Rhys-ponsible quality control: a tutorial on sequence data quality control

To simplify the sequence data in this tutorial, the `seqtk_sample` (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk) tool was used to subsample the raw reads randomly. Furthermore, to ensure reproducibility, the RNG seed was set to the default value of 4.
