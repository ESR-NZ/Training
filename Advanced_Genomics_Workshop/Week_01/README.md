## Prerequisites
To fully benefit from these exercises, it is essential that you manually _type_ each exercise. Please avoid the temptation to copy and paste, as these exercises aim to train your hands, brain, and mind in the fundamental skills of reading, writing, and comprehending code. By copying and pasting, you would be depriving yourself of the valuable learning experience these lessons provide.

This practical session aims to familiarise you with fundamental Linux/Unix commands and provide guidance on utilising command line tools effectively.

You will need a computer running a command line interface (e.g., macOS Terminal, Windows Command Prompt, Linux terminal). 

If you encounter difficulties during this session, we recommend dedicating the next week to thoroughly exploring the Unix tutorial notes available in the Software Carpentry resources. You can access them here: [https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/index.html](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/index.html)

Please utilise Teams for any questions you may have regarding command-line usage. Remember, there is no such thing as a silly question. Learning a new language, including its vocabulary (commands) and grammar (syntax), takes time, and our team is here to assist you throughout the process. So don't hesitate to ask for help!

## Introduction
The command line, also known as the terminal or shell, is a powerful tool for interacting with your computer using text-based commands. This tutorial will guide you through the command line basics and help you get started with everyday tasks.
