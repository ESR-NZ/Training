## Prerequisites
To fully benefit from these exercises, it is essential that you manually _type_ each exercise. Please avoid the temptation to copy and paste, as these exercises aim to train your hands, brain, and mind in the fundamental skills of reading, writing, and comprehending code. By copying and pasting, you would be depriving yourself of the valuable learning experience these lessons provide.

**You will need a computer running a command line interface (e.g., macOS Terminal, Windows Command Prompt, Linux terminal). Participants in the course are expected to have a Linux account on the HPC (High-Performance Computing) system and have their secure shell (SSH) keys set up for server connection. It is crucial to complete these steps beforehand. It is not recommended to perform these tasks on the morning of the course. If any software installation is required on laptops, it is advisable to coordinate with Desktop Support at least a week or two before the course.**

If you encounter difficulties during this session, we recommend dedicating the next week to thoroughly exploring the Unix tutorial notes available in the Software Carpentry resources. You can access them here: [https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/index.html](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/index.html)

Please utilise Teams for any questions you may have regarding command-line usage. Remember, there is no such thing as a silly question. Learning a new language, including its vocabulary (commands) and grammar (syntax), takes time, and our team is here to assist you throughout the process. So don't hesitate to ask for help!

## Introduction
The command line, also referred to as the terminal or shell, is a robust tool for interacting with your computer through text-based commands. This tutorial is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of command line basics and assist you in performing everyday tasks.
In this practical session, we aim to acquaint you with essential Linux/Unix commands and offer guidance on effectively utilising command line tools.
