# A tutorial for genome reconstruction using Google Colaboratory

## Introduction
Once we have assessed the quality of our Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) nanopore sequencing data, the subsequent step is to process the reads to obtain meaningful outcomes. This includes reconstructing the genome, which entails assembling the sequenced reads into a contiguous sequence (contig) representing the organism's genome.

## Getting started
Open your web browser and go to [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/). If you're not already signed in to your Google account, you'll need to sign in first.

Once you're signed in, you'll see the following screen:

## Genome reconstruction (Nanopore)
You will need to click the "GitHub" tab and then paste the following into the search bar:
```bash
https://github.com/WCSCourses/SARS-COV-2_B4B/blob/main/Modules/Module_2_Part2_Nanopore_SARS_CoV_2_genome_reconstruction.ipynb
```
Then press the search button. For example:

This will open the Wellcome Connecting Science repository for genome reconstruction for Nanopore SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing.

## Now, we will utilise the Wellcome Connecting Science repository for Nanopore SARS-CoV-2 genome reconstruction to assemble our sequence data.
