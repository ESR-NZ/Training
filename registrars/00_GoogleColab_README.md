# A tutorial for Google Colaboratory

## Introduction

Google Colaboratory, or Colab, is a free, cloud-based platform for developing and running Python machine learning models. It provides users with a Jupyter notebook environment to write and execute code, visualise data, and collaborate with others in real time. Colab also comes pre-installed with many popular machine learning libraries, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn, making it easy for users to start building and training models. In addition, Colab allows users to easily access and analyse large datasets through integration with Google Drive and Google Cloud Storage. Best of all, Colab requires no setup or installation, as it runs entirely in the browser, making it a convenient and accessible option for students, researchers, and developers alike.

## Prerequisites

To get started with Google Colab, you need:

1) **A [Google account](https://www.google.com/account/about/)**: You will need to have a Google account to use Google Colab. If you do not have a Google account, you can create one for free.

2) **A web browser**: Google Colab runs in your web browser, so you will need a modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge.

3) **Good internet connection**: Since Google Colab is an online tool, it is essential to have a stable and reliable internet connection to ensure smooth operation.

4) _Optional_. **Basic knowledge of Python**: Google Colab is a platform for writing and running Python code. Therefore, having some basic knowledge of Python programming language will be helpful.

5) _Optional_. **GPU or TPU**: If you are planning to train large machine learning models, you may want to use a GPU or TPU to speed up the process. Google Colab provides free access to GPUs and TPUs, but you may need to configure your notebook to use them.

## Getting started
Open your web browser and go to [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/). If you're not already signed in to your Google account, you'll need to sign in first.

Once you're signed in, you'll see the following screen:

## Sequencing run quality control (Nanopore)
You will need to click the "GitHub" tab and then paste the following into the search bar:
```bash
https://github.com/WCSCourses/SARS-COV-2_B4B/blob/main/Modules/Module_2_Part1_Sequencing_Run_QC_(Nanopore_and_Illumina).ipynb
```
Then press the search button. For example:

This will open the Wellcome Connecting Science repository for initial quality control for Nanopore and Illumina SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing.

## Now, we will utilise the Wellcome Connecting Science repository for Initial QC for Nanopore and Illumina SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing to evaluate the quality of our sequence read data.
